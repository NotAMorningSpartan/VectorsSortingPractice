# Vectors/Sorting Practice

This program, written in C++, was originally part of an assignment created by Dr. Lesly Kerby, Idaho State University. In this assignment, we create objects, called Trucks, that have properties such as year, value, color, etc. and methods to facilitate updating and fetching this data. These are used trucks, so there are methods to simulate the dropping of a Truck's value over time.

In this assignment, a vector of 10 trucks was created, their values updated based upon a certain date, and print methods to easily display the properties of said Truck. Then, the trucks in the vector are sorted, first alphabetically by name, and later by mileage. Then, all the trucks are outputted to verify successful sort.
